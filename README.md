## Things to note:- 

I started creating a full fledged smart devices dashboard app. As per the requirements I also started writing service layer for weather information. The data provider and repository can be found inside the packages folder. It has unit tests written as well. 

Then I dropped it midway in lue of time and started on the UI with provider package and changeNotifier. 

Things may seems unfinished but I tried to demonstrate my ability to architect things into layers. 

I will finish the project later on with complete bloc implementation.
